FilmFever Angular is a full-stack JavaScript application that allows users to access information about different movies, genres, and directors. This version of FilmFever uses Angular for the client-side rather then React in the original app. FilmFever uses a built from scratch database and server to provide movie data to users on the application's front-end. Users can create an account, read information about different movies, update their information and favorite movies list, and delete their accounts if desired. These actions follow the core principles that are integral to a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application.

Initial 1.0 Version Duration: January 2022 - Feburary 2022
